# gRPC Health Check service for TS and JS
Health check for gRPC using [@grpc/grpc-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grpc/grpc-js) library.

## Installation

npm install grpc-health-check-ts
```

## Credis
* Based on [grpc-ts-health-check](https://github.com/nicolaspearson/grpc.ts.health.check) but the original code is outdated and depends on no longer supported `grpc` library.
